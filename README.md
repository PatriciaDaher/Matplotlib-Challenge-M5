A. Statistics Table
    Ramicane and Capomulin appear to be the most effective treatments, while Ketapril and Naftisol are the least effective. Tumor volume fluctuated the most under Ketapril, indicating that Ketapril had a significant impact on the tumor but is also the riskiest choice. In contrast, Ramicane had a slower, more stable effect, though it may still not be the best option.
Key Observations:
    Lowest Mean and Median Tumor Volume:
        Mean: Ramicane (40.21) and Capomulin (40.67)
        Median: Ramicane (40.67) and Capomulin (41.55)
    Highest Mean and Median Tumor Volume:
        Mean: Ketapril (55.23) and Naftisol (54.33)
        Median: Ketapril (53.70) and Naftisol (52.50)
    Highest Volume Fluctuation:
        Variance: Ketapril (68.55)
        Standard Deviation: Ketapril (8.28)
    Lowest Volume Fluctuation:
        Variance: Ramicane (23.49)
    Standard Deviation: Ramicane (4.85)
Recommendations:
    Consider Ramicane and Capomulin as potential treatments.
    Investigate Ketapril to identify factors contributing to its high fluctuation.

B. Box Plot: Comparing Capomulin and Ramicane
    Ramicane is the most effective treatment compared to Capomulin and others.
Key Observations:
    The final tumor volume results for Ramicane range between 22 and 45, with a median of 35.
    Infubinol, although seemingly the least effective with results around 72, includes an outlier with a tumor volume of approximately 35.
Recommendations:
    Administer Ramicane as prescribed.
    Analyze the outlier in the Infubinol data to determine whether other factors positively influenced the mouse’s response to treatment. This will provide insights into optimizing treatments or reveal if the result was due to human error.

C. Capomulin Treatment of Mouse l509
    This graph provides deeper insight into the effectiveness of the medication and the tumor’s response. It is clear that the medication reduced the tumor size over a 45-day period, from 45 mm³ to 41.5 mm³, resulting in a total decrease of 3.5 mm³. However, this reduction was not immediate, and the tumor showed some resistance during the treatment period.
    Based on the data, I recommend gradually increasing the treatment dosage after 40 days to enhance its effectiveness.
Key Observations:
    Initial Response (0–20 days):
        The tumor size increased from 45 mm³ to 48 mm³ (a 3 mm³ increase) during the first 20 days, suggesting initial resistance to the treatment.
    Sharp Decline (20–25 days):
        After the initial increase, the tumor size dropped sharply from 48 mm³ to 44 mm³ in the next 5 days, indicating the medication began to take effect.
    Temporary Recovery (25–30 days):
        The tumor attempted to recover, increasing slightly from 44 mm³ to 45 mm³ over the next 5 days. However, this increase was smaller than the initial growth, suggesting the tumor was weakened by the medication.
    Significant Reduction (30–35 days):
        The tumor size decreased significantly from 45 mm³ to 40.5 mm³ in the following 5 days, demonstrating the medication’s continued impact.
    Final Resistance (35–45 days):
        In the final 10 days, the tumor showed some resistance, with a slight increase in size. However, it did not exceed its original volume, ending at 41.5 mm³ by day 45.
Recommendations:
    Patients should expect an initial tumor expansion during the first 20 days of treatment.
    After 40 days, doubling the treatment dosage may help counteract the tumor’s resistance and further reduce its size.

D. Scatter Plot Line Chart
    The smaller the mouse, the better the results, as the tumor size tends to be smaller.
Observation:
    The correlation coefficient is 0.84, indicating a strong positive correlation. As weight decreases, the average tumor volume tends to decrease as well, and the relationship between them is fairly strong.
Recommendations:
    I recommend maintaining a healthy weight to improve treatment efficiency.
